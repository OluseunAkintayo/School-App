==> Return to Home Page

1. Can you redesign this image (drey42.jpg), and enable the wording to just be "HOME"  ... ?
2. Instead of the Graduating cap image you can put an image of Home, similar to wen u try to go to home on websites.
3. Kindly design a page that will have "Registration Successful!! You can login now"
4. The login link will be a button and sufficiently big enough to capture, use the "success" picture as background
5. Under Courses: add a search bar; add a plus / minus buttons to add / remove courses; courses table
